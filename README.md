## 💻 Install

The Mercury Pulsar plugin is now available through the built-in Package Manager in Pulsar. 

1. Open Pulsar.app

2. Click on Packages > Open Package Manager

3. Search for `mercury`

4. Click `Install`

### Commandline

You can also install the package through the commandline. Make sure that `ppm` (Pulsar Package Manager) is installed. On linux and windows, it should be automatically installed with Pulsar. On OSX, go to the `Pulsar` menu and click `Install Shell Commands`.

1. Open the Terminal and type

`ppm install tmhglnd/mercury`

If `ppm` fails, you can also use `pulsar -p`

Optionall you can also first clone this repository and install that manually:

1. Download this repository via 

`$ git clone http://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury-pulsar`

2. Navigate to the directory and install the dependencies

`$ cd mercury-pulsar` and `ppm install`

3. Load the package

`$ ppm link .`

4. Restart Pulsar

<!-- ### For windows users

Windows doesn't support `ppm`, instead use `npm` and the following steps:

1. Download this repository via 

`$ git clone http://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury-pulsar`

2. Navigate to the directory and install the dependencies with `npm` instead of `ppm`

`$ cd mercury-pulsar` and `npm install`

3. Manually copy-paste the entire folder `mercury-pulsar` to

`C:\Users\<username>\.pulsar\packages` -->

## 🎮 Usage

1. Start up either Mercury for Max or the Mercury Playground (running locally!, see instructions below)

2. Create an empty file to open with Pulsar and write your code in. This can be a plain `.txt` file.

3. Go to `Packages` > `Open Package Manager`, find the mercury package and click on `Enable`.

4. The package should be automatically activated. You can toggle the package on/off with `shift` `cmd` `p`, search for `mercury:toggle` and `enter`.

5. Type some code and:

	- Evaluate with `cmd/ctrl/alt`+`enter` 

	- Silence the sound with `cmd/ctrl/alt`+`.`

	- Randomize variables `cmd/ctrl/alt`+`shift`+`r`
