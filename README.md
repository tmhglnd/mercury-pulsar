## üíª Install

Make sure that `ppm` (pulsar package manager) is installed. On linux, it should be automatically installed with atom. On OSX, go to the 'Atom' menu, and click 'Install Shell Commands'. On windows, it doesn't work as of now, read further. If you don't want to install it because it'd name collide with perl's ppm, replace the ppm command in the following actions with pulsar -p.

1. Download this repository via 

`$ git clone http://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury-pulsar`

2. Navigate to the directory and install the dependencies

`$ cd mercury-pulsar` and `ppm install`

3. Load the package

`$ ppm link .`

### For windows users

1. Download this repository via 

`$ git clone http://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury-pulsar`

2. Navigate to the directory and install the dependencies with `npm` instead of `ppm`

`$ cd mercury-pulsar` and `npm install`

3. Manually copy-paste the entire folder `mercury-pulsar` to

`C:\Users\<username>\.pulsar\packages`

## üéÆ Usage

1. Start up either Mercury for Max or the Mercury Playground (running locally!, see instructions below)

2. Create an empty file to open with Pulsar and write your code in. This can be a plain `.txt` file.

3. Go to `Packages` > `Open Package Manager`, find the mercury package and click on `Enable`.

4. The package should be automatically activated. You can toggle the package on/off with `shift` `cmd` `p`, search for `mercury:toggle` and `enter`.

5. Type some code and:

	- Evaluate with `ctrl` `enter` 

	- Silence the sound with `ctrl` `.`
